    Background:
        Given I am authenticated
        And the base uri is "/api/users"


    Scenario: I want to create a new user
        Given the request has the payload:
        """
        {
            "lat": 51,
            "long": 69,
            "pathologies": [
                "Mal de tÃªte"
            ],
            "ameliId": "12345",
            "email": "luke@deen.com",

            "mobilePhone": "1234567890"
        }
        """

        Then the response status code should be 201
        And the user with the email "luke@deen.com" should exist
